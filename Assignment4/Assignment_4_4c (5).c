Purpose: This program finds threshold voltage(vth) for a given set of data values
         Each set is represented by gate current ,vg(i) where i âˆˆ [1,11] .The data values in each set are values of drain current (id) 

Inputs:  The program does't require any inputs
       
Outputs: The program gives Threshold voltage(vth) for data sets from vg1 to vg11

In short ,This is how the program works:
1)takes in data values from the sgfet.cvs file and converts it into arrays  (MANOMUKIL pls check this points if it makes sense ir not)
2)Does linear fitting(regression) for all values of vth varying from vd[0] to vd[401] for a particular data set(vg)
3)calculates error for every arbitary vth and searches the vth for which it gets minimum
4)prints the vth for every vg

/*The program by default uses linear fitting(regression) on both sides of any arbitary vth and tries to minimise the rms error from linear fits by searching for better vth [method 2]
this is done by considering all the points on both sides of that arbitary vth, but we can choose to omit points on eiter sides by changing values of a and b */

int a=0;//a and b represents the number of points to be omited on left and right side of vth respectively.This is similar to choosing linear fits to low and high voltage parts of the graph[method 1](visual explanation of this attached in the submission)
int b=0;// eg1: try setting a = 15 , b = 80 to get vth near 1
